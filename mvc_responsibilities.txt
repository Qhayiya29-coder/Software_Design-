Task Manager Application – MVC Responsibilities 

Models The models are the data part of the system. They store the actual
task information and handle how the data is saved and loaded. In my task
manager app, the model classes represent things like Users, Tasks,
Comments, and Notifications. Models also do small logic connected to the
data, such as updating a task or adding a comment. They do not deal with
user input or screens. They only care about storing and keeping data
correct.

Views The views are what the user sees. They don’t make decisions. Their
job is to show information and take input from the user. A view might
show the list of tasks, a form for adding a task, or a message telling
the user something went wrong. Views should only display things and pass
input to the controller.

Controllers Controllers are the middle part between views and models.
They take input from the view, check it, decide what to do, and call the
model to save or update data. Then they tell the view what to show next.
They contain most of the logic such as validation, permissions, and
deciding which model functions to use.

Summary In short: models store data, controllers make decisions, and
views show things to the user. Keeping them separate makes the app
easier to understand and maintain.
