This project focuses on practising software design techniques by creating the design for a task manager application. The goal was to break the system down into clear parts and represent how it should work before any coding is done.

As part of the task, I created a use case diagram that shows the main actions a user can perform, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. I also made a sequence diagram to show how the system handles a typical operation when working with files for data storage.

I described the responsibilities of the models, views, and controllers based on the MVC pattern. The idea was to explain what each part should handle and how they should stay separated so the system is easier to maintain. I also designed a class diagram to show the structure of the main classes and their relationships. Lastly, I created a CRUD matrix to summarise what operations can be performed on each entity.

This design work helped me plan out the behaviour and structure of the task manager before thinking about implementation. It also showed how software can be organised into clear modules that work together but still keep their own responsibilities.
